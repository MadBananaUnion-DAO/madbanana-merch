Merchandise sales

Holding a Mad Bananas token can qualify you to become a vendor for the Mad Bananas community. As we continue to release new and exciting merchandise and branded items, our readers and members will be on the lookout for ways to get their hands on them. By becoming a vendor, you can help us meet this demand and bring the Mad Bananas community to a wider audience.

All sales of Mad Bananas merchandise will go directly into the community wallet, contributing 100% to its development. This will enable us to expand our merchandise offerings and enhance other parts of the ecosystem. By supporting the Mad Bananas community in this way, you can help us to grow and thrive.

In addition to the benefits of supporting the community, Mad Bananas holders will have the opportunity to utilize their tokens to create personalized products. This means that you can create unique and customized items that reflect your own style and personality, while also supporting the Mad Bananas community.

Moreover, the owner of the MBU on any product will receive a percentage of the sales. This means that by creating and selling customized products, you can help to support your own investment in the Mad Bananas ecosystem. With these benefits and opportunities, holding a Mad Bananas token is not only a great investment, but also a way to support and contribute to a growing and vibrant community.
